# 💱 Currency Converter

A simple and beginner-friendly Python project that converts one currency into another using real-time exchange rates.  
This project is part of my open-source learning journey and aims to help those new to coding, APIs and Python projects.

## 📌 Features

- Converts between major global currencies (for example USD ⇄ INR)  
- Fetches live/external exchange-rates (via a web API)  
- Easy to run with a command‐line interface (CLI)  
- Clean and minimal code suited for beginners in Python and open-source contributions

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**  
- `requests` library (for API calls)  
- Standard Python libraries (for I/O, formatting)  
- *(Mention GUI library if you have one — else skip)*

🔑 API / Configuration Details
This project uses an external currency exchange API to fetch real‐time rates.

If required, obtain your free API key from e.g., ExchangeRate-API or another service.

Insert your API key in main.py like:


API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
Review main.py to ensure you have set the API endpoint or base URL correctly.
